    <h1>L09 - NOTES: HTML5 APIs</h1>

    <p>HTML5 was for HTML what ES6 was for JavaScript – it added a large number of new features to the specification. It also went beyond the actual markup language and brought together a number of related technologies such as CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>The data- Attribute</h3>
    <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. </p>
    <p>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with data-</li>
      <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.</li>
      <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="example">
      data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'<br>
      data-rating = '5' <br>
      data-dropdown <br>
      data-user = 'DAZ' <br>
      data-max-length = '32'
    </p>
    <p>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains. Here’s an example of some markup:</p>
    <p class="example">
      &lt;div id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'><br>
          Superman<br>
      &lt;div>
    </p>
    <p>The data-powers attribute can be accessed using the following code:</p>
    <p class="example">
      const superman = document.getElementById('hero');<br>
      const powers = superman.dataset.powers;<br>
      << 'flight superSpeed'
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      const powers = superman.getAttribute('data-powers');
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      const maxLength = Number(element.dataset.maxLength);
    </p>
    <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
    <p>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.</p>
    <h4>HTML5 Web Storage</h4>
    <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</p>
    <p>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
      <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>
      <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).</li>
      <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. The information is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings. There is also a sessionStorage object that works in the same way, although the data is only saved for the current session.</p>
    <p class="example">
      localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      localStorage.getItem('name'); 
      << "Walter White"
    </p>
    <p>Rather than using the getItem() and setItem() methods, assignment can be used instead. In the next example, we simply reference localStorage.name as if it was a variable to change its value:</p>
    <p class="example">
      localStorage.name = 'Heisenberg'; <br><br>
      console.log(localStorage.name); <br>
      << "Heisenberg";
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      localStorage.removeItem('name');
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      delete localStorage.name;
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      localStorage.clear();
    </p>
    <p>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired. Note that this event is only fired on any other windows or tabs from the same domain, and only if the value of the item being saved changes. The event object sent by the event listener to the callback has a number of properties that provide information about the updated item:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>key tells us the key of the item that changed</li>
      <li>newValue tells us the new value to which it has been changed</li>
      <li>oldValue tells us the previous value before it was changed</li>
      <li>storageArea tells us if it is stored in local or session storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="example">
      addEventListener('storage', (event) => {<br>
        console.log(`The ${event.key} was updated from ${event.oldValue} to ${event.newValue} and saved in <br>
        ${event.storageArea}`) }, false);
    </p>
    <h4>Geolocation</h4>
    <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel. An example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your location. Because of privacy concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.</p>
    <p class="example">
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      function youAreHere(position) {<br>
        console.log(`Latitude: ${position.coords.latitude}, Longitude: ${position.coords.longitude}`); <br>
      }
    </p>

    <h1>L10 - NOTES: CALLBACKS & HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS IN JAVASCRIPT</h1>
    <p><strong>Callbacks and higher-order functions</strong> are some of the most misunderstood concepts in JavaScript. In this post, we will become familiar with them to write pro-level code as JavaScript engineers.</p>
    <p><strong>callback function</strong> is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some sort action.</p>
    <h3>HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS</h3>
    <p>Any function that takes in a function or returns one out is a higher-order function. This is just a term to depict these functions - we call any function that does that a higher-order function - yet there’s nothing unique about them inherently.</p>
    <h3>WHY DO WE EVEN HAVE FUNCTIONS?</h3>
    <p>Let’s see why…</p>
    <h4>CREATE A FUNCTION 10 SQUARED</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Take no input</li>
      <li>Returns 10*10</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>TENSQUARED</h4>
    <p class="example">
      function tenSquared() {<br>
        return 10 * 10;<br>
      }<br>
      tenSquared() // 100
    </p>
    <h4>AND A 9 SQUARED FUNCTION? 125 SQUARED?</h4>
    <p>What principle are we breaking? <strong>DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself )</strong></p>
    <p><strong>We can generalize the function to make it reusable.</strong></p>
    <p class="example">
      function squareNum(num) {<br>
        return num * num;<br>
      }<br>
      squareNum(10); // 100<br>
      squareNum(9); // 81<br>
      squareNum(8); // 64
    </p>
    <h3>GENERALIZING FUNCTIONS</h3>
    <p><strong>Parameters (placeholders)</strong> mean we don’t need to decide what data to run our functionality on until we run the function. We then provide an actual value <strong>(argument)</strong> when we run the function. Higher-order functions follow this same guideline; we might not choose exactly which part of our functionality it is until we run our function.</p>
    <p class="example">
      function copyArrayAndMultiplyBy2(arr) {<br>
        const output = [];<br>
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
          output.push(arr[i] * 2);<br>
        }<br>
        return output;<br>
      }<br>
      const myArray = [1, 2, 3];<br>
      const result = copyArrayAndMultiplyBy2(myArray)
    </p>
    <p>What if you want to copy the array and divide it by 2?</p>
    <p>What principle are we breaking? <strong>DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself )</strong></p>
    <p>We could generalize our function so we pass in our specific instruction only when we run <strong>copyArrayAndManipulate</strong>!</p>
    <p class="example">
      function copyArrayAndManipulate(arr, instructions) {<br>
        const output = [];<br>
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
          output.push(instructions(arr[i]));<br>
        }<br>
        return output;<br>
      }<br><br>      
      function multiplyBy2(input) {<br>
        return input * 2;<br>
      }<br>
      const result = copyArrayAndManipulate([1, 2, 3], multiplyBy2);
    </p>
    <h3>HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE?</h3>
    <p><strong>Functions in Javascript = first-class objects.</strong> In addition to this, let’s highlight some of the other features of functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They can co-exist with and can be handled like other any Javascript object</li>
      <li>Assigned to variables and properties of other objects</li>
      <li>Passed as arguments into functions</li>
      <li>Returned as values from functions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider this piece of code</p>
    <p class="example">
      function copyArrayAndManipulate(arr, instructions) {<br>
        const output = [];<br>
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
          output.push(instructions(arr[i]));<br>
        }<br>
        return output;<br>
      }<br><br>
      
      function multiplyBy2(input) {<br>
        return input * 2;<br>
      }<br>
      const result = copyArrayAndManipulate([1, 2, 3], multiplyBy2);
    </p>
    <h3>WHICH IS OUR HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTION ☝?</h3>
    <p>The outer function that takes in a function is our higher-order.</p>
    <h4>WHICH IS OUR CALLBACK FUNCTION?</h4>
    <p>The function we insert is our callback function.</p>
    <h3>WHY DO WE NEED TO MASTER THESE TWO CONCEPTS?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Callbacks and higher-order functions simplify our code and keep it <strong>DRY.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Declarative readable code:</strong> Map, filter, reduce - the foremost readable way to write code to work with data.</li>
      <li><strong>Pro interview prep:</strong> One of the most popular topics to check in an interview both for mid/senior-level job interviews.</li>
      <li><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript:</strong> Callbacks are a central part of async Javascript, and are under the hood of <strong>promises, async/await.</strong></li>
    </ul>
