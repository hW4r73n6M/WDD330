    <h1>L07 - NOTES: Function Properties and Methods</h1>

    <p>The fact that functions are first-class objects means they can have properties and methods themselves. For example, all functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters the function has.</p>
    <p class="example">
      function square(x) {<br>
          return x*x;<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>If we query the length property, we can see that it accepts one parameter:</p>
    <p class="example">
      square.length<br>
      << 1
    </p>
    <h4>Call and Apply Methods</h4>
    <p>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first argument.</p>
    <p>In the following example, the sayHello() function refers to an unspecific object called this that has a property called name:</p>
    <p class="example">
        function sayHello(){<br>
            return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;<br>
        }
    </p>
    <p>We can create some objects that have a name property, then use the call() method to invoke the sayHello() function, providing each object as an argument. This will then take the value of this in the function:</p>
    <p class="example">
        const clark = { name: 'Clark' };<br>
        const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };<br>
        <br>
        sayHello.call(clark);<br>
        << 'Hello, my name is Clarke'<br>
        <br>
        sayHello.call(bruce);<br>
        << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'
    </p>
    <p>If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first argument, which is always the value of this. For example, let's update the sayHello() function to give a more generalized greeting that’s provided as an argument:</p>
    <p class="example">
        function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){<br>
            return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ this.name }`;<br>
        }
    <br>
        sayHello.call(clark, 'How do you do');<br>
        << 'How do you do, my name is Clark'<br>
        <br>
        sayHello.call(bruce);<br>
        << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'<br>
    </p>
    <p>If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but you need provide null as its first argument. For example, we could call the square() function using the call() method, like so:</p>
    <p class="example">
        square.call(null, 4)<br>
        << 16
    </p>
    <p>The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument:</p>
    <p class="example">
        square.apply(null, [4])<br>
        << 16
    </p>
    <p>This can be useful if the data you’re using as an argument is already in the form of an array, although it's not really needed in ES6, as the spread operator can be used to split an array of values into separate parameters.</p>
    <h4>Custom Properties</h4>
    <p>There is nothing to stop you adding your own properties to functions in the same way that you can add properties to any object in JavaScript. For example, you could add a description property to a function that describes what it does:</p>
    <p class="example">
        square.description = 'Squares a number that is provided as an argument'<br><br>
        << 'Squares a number that is provided as an argument'
    </p>
    <h5>Memoization</h5>
    <p>A useful feature of this is that it provides result caching, or memoization.</p>
    <p>If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return the value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again. For example, say squaring a number was an expensive computational operation that took a long time. We could rewrite the square() function so it saved each result in a cache object that is a property of the function:</p>
    <p class="example">
        function square(x){<br>
            square.cache = square.cache || {};<br>
            if (!square.cache[x]) {<br>
                square.cache[x] = x*x;<br>
            }<br>
            return square.cache[x]<br>
        }
    </p>
    <p>If we try calling the function a few times, we can see that the cache object stores the results:</p>
    <p class="example">
        square(3);<br>
        << 9<br>
        <br>
        square(-11);<br>
        << 121<br>
        <br>
        square.cache;<br><br>
        << {"3": 9, "-11": 121}
    </p>
    <h4>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h4>
    <p>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function definition (remember we use parentheses to invoke a function). The function also has to be made into an expression, which is done by placing the whole declaration inside parentheses, as in this example:</p>
    <p class="example">
        (function(){<br>
        const temp = 'World';<br>
        console.log(`Hello ${temp}`);<br>
        })();<br><br>
        << 'Hello World'
    </p>

    <h1>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h1>
    <h4>Transforms</h4>
    <p>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page. While some of these effects were possible using previously existing CSS features (such as translating with relative and absolute positioning), CSS3 gives you unprecedented control over many more aspects of the element’s appearance.</p>
    <p>We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions. The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they’re provided. In this book, we’ll cover all the two-dimensional transform functions.</p>
    <h4>Translation</h4>
    <p>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes. When you employ a translation function, you’re moving elements without impacting the flow of the document. Unlike position: relative, which allows you to position an element either against its current position or against a parent or other ancestor, a translated element can only be moved relative to its current position.</p>
    <p>The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top:</p>
    <p class="example">
        transform: translate(45px, -45px);
    </p>
    <p>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively. To move 45px to the right along the x axis, include:</p>
    <p class="example">
        transform: translateX(45px);
    </p>
    <p>To move up along the y axis by 30px, include:</p>
    <p class="example">
        transform: translateY(-30px);
    </p>
    <p>For our ad, we want to move the word “dukes” over to the right when the user hovers over it, as if it had been punched by our mustachioed pugilist. In the markup, we have:</p>
    <p class="example">    
      <h1>Put your <span>dukes</span> up, sire</h1>
    </p>
    <h4>Scaling</h4>
    <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing different values will distort the element, as you’d expect:</p>
    <p class="example">
      transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);
    </p>
    <h4>Rotation</h4>
    <p>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.</p>
    <p class="example">
      .ad-ad2 h1:hover span {
          color: #484848;<br>
          transform: rotate(10deg) translateX(40px) scale(1.5);<br>
      }
    </p>
    <h4>Skew</h4>
    <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis:</p>
    <p class="example">
        transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);
    </p>
    <h>Multiple Transitions</h>
    <p>The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call. For example, if we want to change the color at the same time as changing the rotation and size, we can.</p>
    <p class="example">
      transition-property: transform, color;<br>
      transition-duration: 0.2s;<br>
      transition-timing-function: ease-out;<br>
      transition-delay: 50ms;<br>
    </p>

    
    <h1>L08 - NOTES:  JSON Web Token</h1>
    <p>JSON Web Token, or JWT (“jot”) for short, is a standard for safely passing claims in space constrained environments. It has found its way into all major web frameworks. Simplicity, compactness and usability are key features of its architecture. Although much more complex systems are still in use, JWTs have a broad range of applications. In this little handbook, we will cover the most important aspects of the architecture of JWTs, including their binary representation and the algorithms used to construct them, while also taking a look at how they are commonly used in the industry.</p>
    <h3>WHAT IS JSON WEB TOKEN?</h3>
    <p><strong>JSON Web Token (JWT)</strong> is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compact:</strong> Because of its size, it can be sent through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header. Additionally, due to its size its transmission is fast.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-contained:</strong> The payload contains all the required information about the user, to avoid querying the database more than once.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>WHEN SHOULD YOU USE JSON WEB TOKENS?</h3>
    <p>These are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> This is the typical scenario for using JWT, once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used among systems of different domains.</li>
      <li><strong>Information Exchange:</strong> JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties, because as they can be signed, for example using a public/private key pair, you can be sure that the sender is who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn’t changed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>WHICH IS THE JSON WEB TOKEN STRUCTURE?</h3>
    <p>JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Header</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Playload</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Signature</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.</p>
    <p class="example">xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz</p>
    <h4>Header</h4>
    <p>The header <i>typically</i> consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.</p>
    <p class="example">
      {<br>
        "alg": "HS256",<br>
        "typ": "JWT"<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>Then, this JSON is <strong>Base64Url</strong> encoded to form the first part of the JWT.</p>
    <h4>Playload</h4>
    <p>The second part of the token is the payload, which contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional metadata. There are three types of claims: <strong>reserved, public, and private</strong> claims.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Reserved claims:</strong> These are a set of predefined claims, which are not mandatory but recommended, thought to provide a set of useful, interoperable claims. Some of them are: iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), aud (audience), among others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>Notice that the claim names are only three characters long as JWT is meant to be compact.</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public claims:</strong> These can be defined at will by those using JWTs. But to avoid collisions they should be defined in the IANA JSON Web Token Registry or be defined as a URI that contains a collision resistant namespace.</li>
      <li><strong>Private claims:</strong> These are the custom claims created to share information between parties that agree on using them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="example">
      {<br>
        "sub": "1234567890",<br>
        "name": "John Doe",<br>
        "admin": true<br>
      }
    </p>
    <p>The payload is then <strong>Base64Url</strong> encoded to form the second part of the JWT.</p>
    <h4>Signature</h4>
    <p>To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.
      <br>
      For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way.
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      HMACSHA256(<br>
    base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +<br>
    base64UrlEncode(payload),<br>
    secret)
    </p>
    <p>The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message was’t changed in the way.</p>
    <h4>Putting all together</h4>
    <p>The output is three Base64 strings separated by dots that can be easily passed in HTML and HTTP environments, while being more compact compared to XML-based standards such as SAML.
      <br>
      The following shows a JWT that has the previous header and payload encoded and it is signed with a secret.
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      eyJhbGci0iJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.<br>
      eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY30DkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaXNTb2NpYWwi0nRydWV9.<br>
      4pcPyMD09oLPSyXnrXCjTwXyr4BsezdI1AVTmud2fU4
    </p>
    <p>You can browse to <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a> where you can play with a JWT and put these concepts in practice. <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a> allows you to decode, verify and generate JWT.</p>
